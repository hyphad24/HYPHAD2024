We are thrilled to announce the official launch of the **HYPHAD Project**, which has been selected for funding under the prestigious **M-ERA.NET Call 2023**. HyPhAD, short for "Machine Learning-Assisted Design of Metal Hydride Alloys for Hydrogen Applications using CALPHAD Predictive Modelling," aims to revolutionize hydrogen storage technologies by integrating cutting-edge machine learning techniques with CALPHAD modeling.

## Project Consortium
The project brings together a strong consortium of world-class partners:
- **Fraunhofer IFAM (Germany):** Leading the research as the project coordinator, focusing on alloy development and advanced characterization.
- **AGH University of Science and Technology (Poland):** Providing expertise in computational modeling and materials science.
- **WONIL (Korea):** Offering industrial insights and facilitating real-world applications of the developed alloys.

## Objectives
With the project now officially underway, HyPhAD aims to develop cost-effective and efficient hydrogen storage and compression solutions by optimizing the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of metal hydride alloys. 

This collaboration promises to contribute significantly to advancing hydrogen technologies and supporting global transitions toward sustainable energy.

We are excited to begin this journey and look forward to sharing groundbreaking advancements as the project progresses!
