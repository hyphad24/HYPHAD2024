We are proud to announce that the paper **"Advancing the thermodynamic modeling of multicomponent phases in hydrogen-para-equilibrium"** has been accepted for publication in the prestigious journal **Acta Materialia**.

Authored by Dr. Peter Hannappel, Dr. Felix Heubner, Dr. Mateusz Balcerzak, and Dr. Thomas Weißgärber, this groundbreaking work presents a novel approach to thermodynamic modeling of metal hydrides using the CALPHAD framework. The study introduces an open-source Python-based tool for calculating para-equilibrium states in multicomponent hydrogen phases, significantly reducing manual input and improving modeling accuracy. The approach was validated using the (Ce,La)Ni5–H system, providing valuable insights into its sorption properties and phase behavior.

This publication highlights the innovative contributions of the HYPHAD project to advancing hydrogen storage technologies and fostering sustainable energy solutions.

Congratulations to the authors on this outstanding achievement!
