      title: Multiscale Simulation Workflow for Metal Hydride Discovery
      text: Our approach integrates multiscale simulations to accelerate the discovery of innovative metal hydrides. Starting with atomistic models, we leverage machine learning potentials like CHGNet to predict material properties rapidly and accurately. These predictions feed into mesoscale CALPHAD simulations to model thermodynamic and sorption properties. Kinetic Monte Carlo methods simulate reaction kinetics and degradation behaviors. Experimental validation at the microscale ensures the reliability of predictions and refines the models. This iterative workflow enables efficient scaling from lab synthesis to industrial production, bridging theoretical insights and practical applications in hydrogen storage technologies.
